# Axiata_Hackathon
First runner up at a 24 hour hackathon in Kuala Lumpur.

The #1 task was a simple ETL, we had to figure out average customers in a certain area, it included filtering, joining tables, and calculating average in a proper way. It was more like an analyst's task, tell which POI's have the highest income and other details.

The #2 task was to predict air quality in CyberJaya based on a single device's previous data. Time-series prediction was new to me so I have followed online tutorials about data preparing and model selection. Feature engineering was brought to minimum, I have caught the trend function of the historical data and used it as a feature, and I also used the previous weeks' datapoint. 

The #3 task was to come up with a business idea to tackle air quality problem in CyberJaya. We pitched an app that financial motivates you to choose an ecological more efficient vehicle, such as choosing a bus instead of a car would give users Co2 credits that could be used later for collecting discounts or even to monetize it. 

The tasks were solved by a team of 4, and we had 24 hour to deliver the whole solution with check point presentation to the judges.
